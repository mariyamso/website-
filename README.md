# website


## Purpose: Create an online profile to promote my design work and gain more exposure.
Features:  
  * Write articles (=blog)
  * Display design work (=portfolio)
  * Exposure and contact with people
  * Unique, artistic, enjoyable online presence/portfolio representing personality and interests

### Elements I want to include:
1. My skill set is a mix of both coding and design, and I wanted this to be prominent.
2. I’m a big fan of minimalist design and wanted to stick with a mainly black and white palette to allow the design to shine through.
3. I wanted to use my own photo as a hero image to inject some personality into the website.
4. I enjoy the experience of seeing animation as I scroll down a page.
5. I’ve never liked the way in which one Web page jerks to another, so I wanted my transitions to be smooth.
6. I like a generous amount of white space and a full-width layout.
7. Responsiveness is important to me because I want mobile and tablet users to also have an optimal experience.
8. I wanted my case studies to tell a story about my design process, rather than just be a gallery of random images without context.
9. Have links to my Video, Art and Photography work.
